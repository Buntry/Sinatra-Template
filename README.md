##Sinatra Template
 
Personalized Sinatra Template

NOTES : 
	This template utilizes a postgresql environment, making it easy to deploy to Heroku.

BEGINNING POSTGRESQL : 
	Create migrations by writing or more easily via "$ rake db:create migration ... "
	After finishing with your development, run "$ rake db:migrate" and make a new commit

CLONING :
	Just clone it over and remove the .git file if you aren't going to contribute
